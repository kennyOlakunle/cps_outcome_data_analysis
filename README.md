# CPS Outcome Analysis

This repository aims to provide an in-depth analysis of prosecution outcomes within the context of the Crown Prosecution Service.
By utilizing a comprehensive dataset of CPS cases from year 2014 - 2018, this project delves into the factors that influence prosecution outcomes and sheds light on the various aspects that contribute to case resolutions. Outcomes are broken down into two categories, convictions and unsuccessful outcomes. Convictions comprise guilty pleas, convictions after trial and cases proved in the absence of the defendant. Unsuccessful outcomes represent all outcomes other than a conviction, comprising discontinuances and withdrawals, discharged committals, dismissals and acquittals, and administrative finalisations. Our objective is to extract meaningful insights from this data to gain a deeper understanding of the CPS system and its impact on the administration of justice.

Main data in analysis:

Offences are divided into: homicide, offences against the person, sexual offences, burglary, robbery, theft and handling, fraud and forgery, criminal damage, drugs offences, public order, motoring, and all other offences excluding motoring.
